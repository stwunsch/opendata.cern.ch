The analysis follows loosely <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370269312008581\">the official CMS analysis published in 2012</a>.</p><p>TODO: What is this analysis about?</p><p>Two example results produced by this analysis can be seen below. The plots show the data recorded by the detector compared to the estimation of the contributing processes, which are explained in the following. The analysis has implemented the visualization of 34 such observables.</p><p><img src=\"https://github.com/stwunsch/HiggsToFourLeptonsNanoAODOutreachAnalysis/blob/master/plots/combined_Higgs_mass.png?raw=true\" width=50% align=\"middle\"><img src=\"http://cms-results.web.cern.ch/cms-results/public-results/publications/HIG-12-028/CMS-HIG-12-028_Figure_004.png" width=50% align=\"middle\"></p>"

      "description": "<p><strong>Set up your system with the required software and code</strong></p><p>The analysis can be run with a plain ROOT installation, either installed locally or taken from the <a href=\"/record/252\">CMS Open Data VM</a> environment. Alternatively, go to <a href=\"https://root.cern\">root.cern</a> for instructions how to install the software locally.</p><p>In case your system has a CVMFS installation, or you can use the CMS Open Data VM environment, you can set up the needed software sourcing an <a href=\"http://lcginfo.cern.ch/\">LCG software release</a> with the following setup script:</p><p><code>source /cvmfs/sft.cern.ch/lcg/views/LCG_95/x86_64-slc6-gcc8-opt/setup.sh</code></p><p>Note that you may have to replace <code>x86_64-slc6-gcc8-opt</code> with a platform matching your system.</p><p>To download the files, you can either use directly the web browser or the following command.<p><code>git clone git://github.com/cms-opendata-analyses/HiggsTauTauNanoAODOutreachAnalysis -b 2012</code></p><p><strong>Step 1: Reduce and pre-process the inital datasets</strong></p><p>This step is implemented in the file <code>skim.cxx</code> and is written in C++ for performance reasons. To compile the program, run the following command. Note that you may need to change the compiler based on your system.<p><code>g++ -g -O3 -o skim skim.cxx $(root-config --cflags --libs)</code></p><p>The compilation produces a binary, which can be executed as follows.<p><code>./skim</code></p><p>The initial datasets are retrieved via network using the <a href=\"http://xrootd.org/\">XRootD</a> protocol and due to the large size of the dataset the runtime is mainly dependent on your network connection. To speed up multiple executions of the analysis, you can download the files and point to these local copies in the code. </p></p><p><strong>Step 2: Produce histograms</strong></p><p>The next step is implemented in Python in the file <code>histograms.py</code>. Run the following command to process the previously produced reduced datasets.<p><code>python histograms.py</code></p><p>The script produces the file <code>histograms.root</code>, which contains the histograms. You can have a look at the plain histograms with the ROOT browser opened with the command <code>rootbrowse histograms.root</code>.</p></p><p><strong>Step 3: Combine histograms to plots</strong></p><p>To combine the histograms produced in the previous step to meaningful plots, run the following command.<p><code>python plot.py</code></p><p>The Python script generates for each variable a <code>png</code> and <code>pdf</code> image file, which can be viewed with a program of your choice. The final plots of the analysis are also included in the source code repository.</p></p>"
